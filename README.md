# Summary

This is a work in progress with limited functionality as described
below.

When finished, this will allow for minor development and testing of
[ansible-dcnm](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-dcnm)
modules (and other REST API-based applications) without requiring a
real ND/NDFC instance.

Basically, it will accept GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests to
endpoints supported by ND/NDFC and will return responses that
align, as closely as possible, with real ND/NDFC responses i.e.,
POST and PUT requests update an in-memory SQLlite database;
GET requests retrieve from this database; and DELETE requests
remove items from the database.
